        <h3>About Jim</h3>
        <p>James “Jim” Yergey retired from his chemist career in pharmaceutical manufacturing in 2014 to follow his love of beer and brewing. Shortly after retiring, Jim entered and won Fegley’s Allentown BrewWork’s “Be a Brewer for a Day” competition. During this competition, Jim brewed the official beer of Lehigh Valley’s Beer Week that year.</p>
        <p>Jim Yergey used to brew at home on and off for many years, and he tossed around the idea of opening his own brewery, but he never chased the thought until after winning Lehigh Valley’s Beer Week. He quickly began looking for locations to open his business.</p>
        <p>Yergey Brewing Company opened in September 2016, making Jim Yergey a proud owner and operator of a nano-brewery. You can find Jim spending time at Yergey Brewing chatting with customers, enjoying live music and various food trucks, hosting fun events to bring the community together, and of course, drinking a freshly brewed craft beer.</p>

        <h3>About Matt</h3>
        <p>Matt Yergey, Jim’s son, is the head brewer at Yergey Brewing. Matt got his love for drinking and brewing craft beer from his father, who always kept a stocked fridge of beer. Matt and his brother gifted their dad a home-brewing kit for Christmas one year, sparking a family tradition of brewing while home for the holidays together.</p>
        <p>Matt’s passion for brewing sprung from these moments. He continued to learn and grow as a brewer, learning as much as he could while living out in Oregon. He enjoys brewing with family and friends to this day, who help him find fun, new flavors to try.</p>

        <h3>About Yergey Brewing</h3>
        <p>Yergey Brewing originally opened on Bank Street, located in a small alley in Emmaus, PA. Yergey Brewing originally shared a building with Triple Sun Spirits, a local distillery. The original location had a 21/2-barrel system, which allowed them to keep 8 taps. However, they quickly outgrew the limited space.</p>
        <p>Yergey Brewing moved its taproom and brewery to 235 Main Street, just several blocks away from their original site. The new location on Main Street opened in September 2021, allowing them to keep 20 taps on hand and accommodate for around 100 people.</p>
        <article>Hoptileitious, the brew that won Lehigh Valley’s Beer Week back in 2014, can still be found on tap today.</article>
